# Weighted graph
This pjoject represent a weighted graph. The Data structor in this project are based on JAVA HashMap.
Each graph is represented with: 
"vertices"-a HashMap that contains all this graph vertices. 
every vertex in the graph has key (integer), info(string),tag(double) . 
Each graph has "Edges" - a HashMap that contains all this graph edges, every edge in this graph has Snode- the source node,
Dnode-the destination node and weight. the weight is un-negative.
Each graph has "neighbors" - a HashMap that cantains each node HashMap that represent the neighbors of the node. 
the graph supports basic methods like addNode, removeNode and a little more complex like shortestPath and more.
